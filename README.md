# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction (Python + SQL)

A predictive analytics project using **SQL** for data transformation and **Python** for machine learning to identify customers likely to churn from a telecom company.  
Achieved an **83% accuracy** using a Random Forest Classifier and derived actionable insights for improving customer retention.

---

## 🔍 Introduction

Customer churn poses a major threat to telecom providers, impacting both revenue and growth. This project demonstrates how businesses can use data-driven solutions to anticipate and reduce customer churn by leveraging structured data and predictive modeling techniques.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

- Predict which customers are likely to leave the telecom service.
- Understand key factors influencing churn such as **tenure**, **contract type**, and **payment method**.
- Support marketing and retention teams with actionable insights to reduce churn rates and improve loyalty.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Telecom companies struggle with high customer churn due to competitive pricing, low customer satisfaction, and poor service delivery. By analyzing customer behavior and account information, we aim to:

- Predict churn probability with machine learning.
- Highlight top features contributing to churn.
- Suggest actionable strategies to retain customers.

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **📥 Data Extraction (SQL):**
   - Queried customer data directly from a relational database using `pyodbc`.
   - Cleaned data at the source using SQL commands for efficiency.

2. **🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python):**
   - Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric, handled nulls, encoded categorical variables.
   - Feature selection and correlation analysis using heatmaps.

3. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized churn by contract type, gender, tenure, and monthly charges.
   - Identified patterns correlating with churn behavior.

4. **🧠 Model Training:**
   - Built a **Random Forest Classifier** with an 83% accuracy score.
   - Evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance.

5. **📈 Business Insights:**
   - Customers with short tenure and month-to-month contracts were at higher risk.
   - Electronic check payment and higher monthly charges correlated with churn.
